      <h2 className="ui black header">Creative teaching with Musiika</h2>

      <p>MuSiika is a tool that combines the music education with a development
      of pupilsÂ´ programming skills.</p>

      <h3>Why use Musiika?</h3>

      <p>Musiika supports collaboration skills, creative thinking and logical reasoning.</p>

      <h3>Lesson plan: Pachelbel's Canon</h3>

      <p>Piece known as "Pachelbel's Canon" was composed by Johann Pachelbel in
      17th century. It belongs fundamentally to the history of music
      representing the Baroque era. Moreover, it's elements (especially the
      chord progression) can be found in many pop music song. In respect of
      music theory Pachelbel's Canon introduces the technique of canon and
      ground bass.</p>

      <p>We can use Musiika to introduce this great piece of music in a manner
      that the pupils can really dive in the logics of music. The teacher can
      divide the class in groups. This supports peer learning and develops
      collaboration skills. Each group will compose Pachelbel's canon of
      their own. MuSiika has been designed so that each pupil have an
      editor where they can compose a part of their own independently. This
      can be compared to an orchestra, one group member representing violins
      another cellos. Composing occurs in terms of simple commands. One can
      program a set of notes and listen the melody created. Ready version is
      sent to the teacher. Teacher can combine different parts and play them
      simultaneously. The symphony is ready!</p>

      <p>The task can be performed at many levels.</p>

      <p>1) Routine practice of musical notations and programming structures:
        pupils can converts straight a sheet of music to commands that play
        the music</p>
      <p>2) pupils can create melodies of their own. Like in Pachelbel's canon
      the teacher can set a chord progression that must be followed. That also
      ensures that separately composed parts will play in harmony.</p>

      <p>to  Each member has their own responsibility of their own part.
      Divide and conquer.
      This provides an environment of learning logical thinking,  programming conditions function</p>

      <p>Music production is strongly connected to technology. The purpose of MuSiika is to enlarge the variety of teaching methods </p>
