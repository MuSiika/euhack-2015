      <p>MuSiika is a tool that combines the music education with a development
      of pupilsÂ´ programming skills.</p>
      <p>Musiika supports collaboration skills, creative thinking and logical reasoning.</p>

      <h3>Lesson plan: Pachelbel's Canon</h3>

      <p>Piece known as "Pachelbel's Canon" was composed by Johann Pachelbel in
      17th century. It belongs fundamentally to the history of music
      representing the Baroque era. Moreover, it's elements (especially the
      chord progression) can be found in many pop music song. In respect of
      music theory Pachelbel's Canon introduces the technique of canon and
      ground bass.</p>

    <p>
      We can use MuSiika to introduce "Pachelbel's Canon" in a manner that the pupils can really dive in the logics of music.
      We suggests that the class is divided into groups.
      This supports peer learning and develops collaboration skills.
      Each group will compose Pachelbel's canon of their own. Each pupil have an editor where they can compose a part of their own independently.
      This can be compared to an orchestra, one group member representing violins another cellos.
      Composing occurs in terms of simple commands.
      Students program a set of notes and listen the melody created.
      Ready version is sent to the teacher, and the teacher combines different parts and play them simultaneously.
      The symphony is ready!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Routine practice of musical notations and programming structures:
        pupils can converts straight a sheet of music to commands that play the music.
      </li>
      <li>Pupils can create melodies of their own.
        Like in Pachelbel's canon the teacher can set a chord progression that must be followed.
        That also ensures that separately composed parts will play in harmony.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduce pupils to technology for music and connect pupils everyday experiences with music to wider context of technology in everyday life.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Furthermore, working together with abstract goals promotes 21st century skills.
      Each student is responsible for their own part, but they need to communicate and collaborate to ensure succesful music composition.
      Furthermore, the task requires analytical approach; that is planning and computational thinking.
