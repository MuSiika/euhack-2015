MuSiika
=============================

Programming education, such as any other school subject, should be _contextualized_ into the "real world."
However, current attempts in programming education consider programming as a silo; a separate subject which is poorly linked to other subjects and hardly at all linked to real world phenomenas.

We promote the idea that programming education should be _integrated_ to other school subjects, and develop a tool - MuSiika - as a prototype of this approach.
It combines the music education with a development of pupils' programming skills.

With MuSiika pupils can use JavaScript to create their own music, using the real syntax and semantics of a real language (or "adult language" as kids call it in Helsinki).
Each student is responsible for an instrument, and send them for intergation.
In integration, these instruments are played together to create a symphony (or a cacophonic mess).
